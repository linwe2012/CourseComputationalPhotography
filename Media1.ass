Dialogue: 2,0:00:04.05,0:00:08.90,Default,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}Draw lines to indicate best part of different Images
Dialogue: 2,0:00:08.95,0:00:11.17,Default,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}Select fast init for faster solution of Gradients
Dialogue: 2,0:00:11.25,0:00:18.20,Default,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}Use different metrices to choose regions in images
Dialogue: 2,0:00:18.40,0:00:22.55,Default,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}Note some metrices like match color & edge doesnt peform well
Dialogue: 2,0:00:22.90,0:00:31.17,Default,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}You can see which regions are selected for different images
Dialogue: 2,0:00:31.35,0:00:41.77,Default,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}Some metrices select more plausible regions
Dialogue: 2,0:00:44.85,0:00:54.50,Default,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}Some metrics produce worser results
Dialogue: 2,0:00:59.87,0:01:17.22,Default,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}Now we enter HD mode, where compuation is more expensive and consumes more time
Dialogue: 2,0:01:19.13,0:01:30.27,Default,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}MatchGradient is much slower but produce better results than MatchColor
Dialogue: 2,0:01:30.40,0:01:39.25,Default,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}If still not satified by the results, you can add more strokes or more image to guide the algorithm
Dialogue: 2,0:01:39.45,0:01:46.87,Default,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}The man in the middle is picked from new image
Dialogue: 2,0:01:47.47,0:02:12.87,Default,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}Now I'm playing with MatchColor. It takes much more strokes but still produces worser results than Match Gradients
