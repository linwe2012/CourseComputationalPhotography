1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,050
Select A Image from Gallery

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,900
Draw lines to indicate best part of different Images

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,175
Select fast init for faster solution of Gradients

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,200
Use different metrices to choose regions in images

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,550
Note some metrices like match color & edge doesnt peform well

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:31,175
You can see which regions are selected for different images

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:41,775
Some metrices select more plausible regions

8
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:54,500
Some metrics produce worser results

9
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:17,225
Now we enter HD mode, where compuation is more expensive and consumes more time

10
00:01:19,138 --> 00:01:30,275
MatchGradient is much slower but produce better results than MatchColor

11
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:39,250
If still not satified by the results, you can add more strokes or more image to guide the algorithm

12
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:46,875
The man in the middle is picked from new image

13
00:01:47,475 --> 00:02:12,875
Now I'm playing with MatchColor. It takes much more strokes but still produces worser results than Match Gradients
