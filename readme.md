## Computational Photography

This is a repo for computational photography at ZJU.

`labs/` contains 5 labs

- `lab2`: Basic filters, including a multi-thread median filter faster than OpenCV (tested with 8 threads, while opencv has one thread only).

- `lab3`: Sparse Matrix & Gauss-Seidel Implementation

- `lab4`: Least Mean Sqaure optimization with Gauss-Newton (The course is haunted by gauss)

- `lab5`: AR application using Vuforia + Unity.

- `lab8`: Paranoma, stitching + gradient domain fushion


`project/` contains final project for Digital Photomontage
